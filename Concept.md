# The Concept for near arctic area

Create a main powerplant for household electrical needs. Goal is to get free and unlimited energy at the time of consume. That means initial investement does not be in usage costs, they are included in contruction cost.

# Step 1 - start with a small powerplant

Small powerplant will cover a small house with 2 persons energy needs with limited needs. It will be a backup system for a mail powerplant, which will cover a small family needs without limting virtually anything.
It is build with solar, wind and ecodiesel generator. They will 'feed' the batteries and inverted electricity will be distributed on house.
Planned house equipments are at the minimum, fridge, lights (in and out), TV, Blender, Coffee grainder & Esspresso machine. The electical components are provided by Victron energy , Sunwind etc. Scalable system starts with 2,1 kW inverter (peak 2,2) and realtime online monitoring. 
Majority of the power comes from 0,4 kW wind turbine and secondary is solar panels. As a backup is 4.4 kW green diesel generator. Generator as the rest of the powersources are automatically controlled by victron systems.

Batteries are at start level Sunwind AGM 360 Ah lead based box.
