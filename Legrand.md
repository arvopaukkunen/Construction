1. If there is an Internet router in the home, use a smartphone to check if the WiFi 
signal is strong enough in the chosen place.
2. If there isnâ€™t a router yet, choose a place near a fibre or telephone outlet
 which will be used for the router.
3. Install the gateway power outlet Control where the selected standard power 
outlet is. This is compatible with standard, 40mm-deep flush-mounting boxes 
attached with screws or claws.
