*Iteration 2*

## Description of this iteration:

### Appliance table
This holds a house device like washing machine etc or a AC or heatpump besic information. Connection prefixed fields holds needed information to connect the device for reading or writing a data. For example connection protocol is something like ModbusSerial, ModbusTCP, MQTT or more convinient REST API if available/implemented. All in LAN.

### Sensor table
Related table with Appliance, holds possible many endpoints / sensors in that appliance and a current value. Value depends on the sensor. It may be something like %, mV, Celsius etc. depends on purpose. That purpose and unit is also what is classification and is used to dataprofiling. Profiled data is simply executed all the time when sensor data is transferred to cloud - for AI to do some clever things to it :
