# Powerplant

Goal is to get off-grid electricity in arctic area, and get a work-arounds for low wind, low temperature, ow light conditions. And still make unlimited amount of power with no cost of all - when the poower is consumed.

When you think of buying a new inverter, it is important to escape from the marketing gimmicks, and understand some basic related facts, eventually of much help before purchasing an inverter. Selecting the right kind of an inverter/battery system is one such important factor. And not just selecting the right inverter-battery system, it is important to select the right solution that solves your need. In this slightly longish post, we will discuss on various power backup solutions, their pros and cons in different situations.
## What are the various alternate power supply solutions?
- **Inverter:** It is a simple device that stores electricity from the grid in a battery and uses the DC (direct current) power from battery and converts it into AC (alternating current) that is used by appliances. Although interchangeably used, but Inverter and UPS are slightly different and we will explain that later in this post. Inverters are generally good if you want backup for small household appliances like lights, fans, TV, computers, etc. However these daysâ€™ bigger inverters can also support Refrigerators, Washing Machines and Mixer Grinders. But then adding these big appliances significantly increases the size of Inverter-Battery system and it is best if one can avoid using them on Inverter. Using inverters for ACs is strictly not suggested.
- **DG Sets:** DG sets use the power of Diesel to generate electricity. They generate instantaneous electricity rather than storing it. They are good for larger loads. So if you want to run ACs, Refrigerators, Motors, etc on power backup, then using DG set can be a good solution.
- **Solar Power:** Solar PV is slowly and steadily gaining popularity and is a great way to generate power backup. Energy from Sunlight is converted into electricity and stored in batteries. However the limitations of Solar Power are similar to that of regular inverters, so they are still not the best solution for bigger loads.
- **Wind:** 
- **Water stream:**
- **Other** New inventions, Hydrogen etc.
