# Walkways purpose

In fact, we need covered walkways to the yard so that we can access the woodshed and, if necessary, other yard chores even in the harsh winter time - even in old age. In addition, there is no need to drive cars into the yard. 

Purpose is to preserver natural stage of the forest meadow. This is simply, becaude when we do 'let' the little fellows like rodents, snakes, ants and all others live in pease - they do not need to come in and seek food or shelter in our quarters.

## Proved in practise
Last 4 years withoud any conflicts with animals and other original inhabitants - or even plants proves that even I have all the IoT gadgets in the world here - the true measurements are this forest ecosystem. It seem to accept us here just fine as a one of the inhabitants like the originals.

### If you behave - you can stay
Sound a legend or even scary, but a Bear has been visiting our place, without revealing him self. But we can smell him and hear his breath.
Bobcats, Foxes are shy, but cctv catches them easilly - mostly night time.

Very clearly we are welcome here and thousands of birds - even rare one, are there and the most friendly ones like forest rabbits and squirrels.
